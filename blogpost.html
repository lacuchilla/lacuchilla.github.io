<h4>What we are learning this week</h4>
<h5>October 26, 2015</h5>
<article>We are now in the sixth week of classes, and I'm amazed at all of the things I have accomplished. I am writing programs in Ruby, making web pages using HTML, testing using Rspec and navigating the terminal like a champ. I'm really grateful for all of the support I have received from my fellow students and the Ada staff. Being a part of this program is an opportunity for me to grow personally as well as professionally, and it's been an intense and wonderful experience.</article>
