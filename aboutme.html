<article>I have been learning about programming on my own for the past two years, but never learned enough to make things. I mostly looked at tutorials, attempted a couple of MOOCs, and went to dozens of tech events. Now, I'm in Ada. I write a bunch of code and I am writing programs I couldn't write six weeks ago. </article>
